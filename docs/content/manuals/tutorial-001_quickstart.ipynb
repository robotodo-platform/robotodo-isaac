    "- Make sure you have completed [0.Installation](tutorial-000_installation.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you have your [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) editor set up and ready, \n",
    "as the tutorials that follow will use Jupyter notebooks as their primary\n",
    "teaching medium. Popular IDEs such as VS Code have support for Jupyter notebooks through\n",

    "\n",
    "- Make sure you have internet. In NVIDIA Omniverse, extensions used by `robotodo.engines.isaac` \n",
    "need to be pulled from NVIDIA's server on demand. Our tutorials may also load assets from the internet.\n",
    "Offline installation is, again, possible but is out of scope for this document.\n",

    "- (Optional) Check for GPU support.\n",
    "    In NVIDIA Omniverse, a GPU with RT cores is required for rendering (e.g. capturing images from cameras).\n",
    "    Typically, this means that you need to have an RTX-series or L40-series NVIDIA GPU for rendering-based\n",
    "    workflows. In this tutorial, since we are working with cameras, a capable GPU is indeed required.\n",
    "    However, you are free to skip the relevant sections if you have unsupported hardware. [^ref-nvidia_gpu_support]\n",
    "    \n",
    "[^ref-nvidia_gpu_support]: For more information, \n",
    "    see NVIDIA’s discussion of why Omniverse requires RTX-class GPUs\n",
